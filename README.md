## Troubleshooting
* Category/monster names that are multiple words don't work.
	* This is due to subsequent words being counted as different arguments in the command
	* To fix use underscores in the category/monster name
	* :x: "::bt quest items"
	* :heavy_check_mark: "::bt giant rat"
	* :x: "::bt quest items"
    * :heavy_check_mark: "::bt giant_rat"
